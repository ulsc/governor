# Getting Started with Governor

Governor is a CLI tool for security-auditing AI-generated applications. It runs a mix of AI-powered and deterministic rule-based checks against your source code, then produces detailed reports in Markdown, JSON, and HTML.

This guide walks you through installation, your first audit, and understanding the output.

## Prerequisites

- **No prerequisites for rule-based checks.** Governor works out of the box — just install and run.
- **An AI provider** is needed only for AI-powered checks — see [Configuration](./configuration.md) for details.
- `codex` CLI in your `PATH` if using the `codex-cli` provider.

> **Zero-config ready:** You can run `governor audit .` immediately after installation. When no AI provider is configured, Governor automatically falls back to rule-engine checks (hardcoded credentials, command injection, prompt injection, etc.) — no API keys, no network, no setup required.

## Installation

### Install script (recommended)

The fastest way to install Governor is with the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://governor.sh/install.sh | bash
```

This detects your platform, downloads the latest release, verifies the checksum, and installs the binary. You can override the install directory:

```bash
INSTALL_DIR=/opt/bin curl -fsSL https://governor.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Supported platforms: Linux (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64), Windows (amd64 via WSL/Git Bash/MSYS2).

### Build from source

> Requires **Go 1.22+** ([download](https://go.dev/dl/))

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd governor
make build
```

This produces a binary at `./bin/governor`.

### Install to your PATH

```bash
make install
```

This copies the binary to `~/.local/bin/governor`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

### Verify the installation

```bash
governor version
```

You should see the installed version (e.g. `governor v0.1.0`). You can also run `governor help` to see the full usage summary.

## Your First Audit

### Option A: Quickstart wizard (recommended for new users)

The fastest way to get started is the interactive quickstart wizard:

```bash
governor quickstart
```

The wizard walks you through four steps in about 30 seconds:

1. **Detects your project type** (Next.js, Express, Go, Python, etc.) automatically
2. **Initializes `.governor/`** directory with config, gitignore, and checks folder
3. **Installs a pre-commit hook** (if you're in a git repository) that runs quick audits on staged files before every commit
4. **Optionally sets up AI** with step-by-step instructions for Codex, OpenAI, or Claude
5. **Runs your first audit** immediately with `--quick` (rule-engine only, instant results)

Each step is a Y/n prompt with sensible defaults — press Enter to accept.

### Option B: Manual setup

#### 1. Initialize the workspace (optional)

Run `governor init` inside your repository to scaffold the `.governor/` directory:

```bash
governor init
```

This creates:
- `.governor/checks/` for custom check definitions
- `.governor/.gitignore` to keep runs out of version control
- `.governor/config.yaml` with commented defaults you can customize

This step is optional — Governor creates the `runs/` directory automatically when you run an audit. But initializing upfront gives you a config file and checks directory ready for team use.

If you want to set an AI profile at init time:

```bash
governor init --ai-profile openai
```

#### 2. Run an audit

Point Governor at any source folder or `.zip` archive:

```bash
governor audit ./my-app
```

That's it. Governor will:

1. **Stage** a filtered workspace -- copying only source files and skipping binaries, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.git`, symlinks, and other non-source content.
2. **Select checks** -- loading the 10 built-in checks (3 AI-powered, 7 rule-based) plus any custom checks you've defined.
3. **Execute** checks in parallel (up to 3 workers by default).
4. **Generate reports** with deduplicated findings.

#### 3. Watch progress

If you're running in an interactive terminal, Governor displays a live TUI showing worker status, durations, and events. In non-interactive environments (CI, pipes), it falls back to plain log output.

You can control this explicitly:

```bash
# Force the TUI on
governor audit ./my-app --tui

# Force plain output (useful for CI)
governor audit ./my-app --no-tui
```

#### 4. Review the summary

When the audit completes, Governor prints a summary to stdout:

```
run id:         a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab
artifacts dir:  ./.governor/runs/20260214-103000/
audit markdown: ./.governor/runs/20260214-103000/audit.md
audit json:     ./.governor/runs/20260214-103000/audit.json
audit html:     ./.governor/runs/20260214-103000/audit.html
checks:         10 (builtin=10 custom=0)
check engines:  ai=5 rule=5
findings:       7 (critical=1 high=3 medium=2 low=0 info=1)
worker appsec                  status=completed  findings=2 duration=45000ms
worker deps_supply_chain       status=completed  findings=1 duration=32000ms
worker secrets_config          status=completed  findings=1 duration=38000ms
worker prompt_injection        status=completed  findings=0 duration=120ms
worker hardcoded_credentials   status=completed  findings=2 duration=85ms
worker command_injection       status=completed  findings=1 duration=60ms
...
```

## Understanding the Output

All artifacts are written to `./.governor/runs/<timestamp>/` by default. You can customize this with `--out`:

```bash
governor audit ./my-app --out ./my-audit-results
```

### Output files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `audit.md` | Human-readable Markdown report with all findings, evidence, and remediation guidance |
| `audit.json` | Machine-readable JSON for automation, CI gates, and integrations |
| `audit.html` | Standalone HTML report for sharing with stakeholders |
| `audit.sarif` | SARIF v2.1.0 export for GitHub Code Scanning integration |
| `manifest.json` | List of all files that were included in the audit workspace |
| `worker-<check-id>.log` | Raw execution log for each check worker |
| `worker-<check-id>-output.json` | Structured output from each check worker |
| `workspace/` | Staged source files (deleted by default; kept on warning/failed runs with `--keep-workspace-error`) |

### Anatomy of a finding

Each finding in the report includes:

- **title** -- what was found
- **severity** -- `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `info`
- **category** -- classification like `auth`, `secrets`, `rce`, `crypto`, etc.
- **evidence** -- specific code or configuration that triggered the finding
- **impact** -- what could go wrong if this isn't addressed
- **remediation** -- concrete steps to fix the issue
- **file_refs** -- which files are affected
- **confidence** -- 0 to 1 score indicating detection certainty
- **source_track** -- which check produced this finding

### Example finding (from audit.json)

```json
{
  "title": "Hardcoded API key or token detected",
  "severity": "critical",
  "category": "secrets",
  "evidence": "api_key = \"sk-abc123...\" in config/settings.py:14",
  "impact": "Exposed API keys can be used by attackers to access your services and incur costs",
  "remediation": "Use environment variables or a secrets vault to store API keys. Rotate any exposed keys immediately.",
  "file_refs": ["config/settings.py"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "source_track": "hardcoded_credentials"
}
```

## Built-in Checks

Governor ships with 10 built-in checks that run by default:

### AI-powered checks (require an AI provider)

| Check ID | Name | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| `appsec` | Application Security | Auth flaws, input validation, data exposure, RCE paths |
| `deps_supply_chain` | Dependencies and Supply Chain | Risky deps, lockfile hygiene, CI/CD supply chain |
| `secrets_config` | Secrets and Security Configuration | Hardcoded secrets, insecure defaults, missing headers |
| `ssrf` | Server-Side Request Forgery | User-controlled URLs passed to server-side HTTP clients |
| `missing_rate_limiting` | Missing Rate Limiting | Sensitive endpoints without throttling |
| `insecure_deserialization` | Insecure Deserialization | Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data |

### Rule-based checks (no AI required, fully offline)

| Check ID | Name | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| `prompt_injection` | Prompt Injection Signals | Prompt override and jailbreak phrases |
| `hardcoded_credentials` | Hardcoded Credentials | Passwords, API keys, tokens in source |
| `command_injection` | Command Injection Patterns | OS command injection via string interpolation |
| `path_traversal` | Path Traversal Patterns | Directory traversal via user input |
| `insecure_crypto` | Insecure Cryptography | Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, DES, ECB mode) |

## Quick Mode (Rule-Only, No AI)

Use `--quick` to run only the deterministic rule-engine checks. No AI provider, no network calls, no API keys needed:

```bash
governor audit ./my-app --quick
```

This runs all `engine: rule` checks (both built-in and custom) and typically completes in under a second. It's ideal for:
- Local development feedback loops
- Environments without AI provider access
- Pre-commit hooks (see [Hooks](#pre-commit-hook) below)

### Automatic quick mode

When you run `governor audit` without any AI configuration (no `--ai-profile`, no `ai_profile` in config, no API key environment variables), Governor **automatically falls back to quick mode**. This means new users get useful results immediately:

```bash
# No config needed — auto-detects absence of AI and runs rule checks
governor audit .
```

After the audit, Governor prints a hint showing how to enable AI-powered checks:

```
5 rule-engine checks completed (no AI key needed)

Want deeper analysis? Add an AI profile:
  governor init --ai-profile openai
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  governor audit .
```

This auto-quick behavior only activates when no AI settings are present anywhere — CLI flags, repo-local config, or global config. Once you configure an AI profile, `governor audit` uses the full check suite.

You can also select individual rule checks explicitly:

```bash
governor audit ./my-app \
  --only-check prompt_injection \
  --only-check hardcoded_credentials
```

## Incremental Scanning (Git-Aware)

Instead of scanning your entire codebase every time, Governor can target only the files you've changed. Three mutually exclusive flags control this:

| Flag | Scans |
|------|-------|
| `--changed-only` | Files with uncommitted changes vs HEAD |
| `--changed-since <ref>` | Files changed since a git ref (branch, tag, or commit) |
| `--staged` | Files staged in the git index |

All three require a git repository.

```bash
# Scan only uncommitted changes
governor audit . --changed-only

# Scan only changes since branching from main
governor audit . --changed-since main

# Scan only staged files
governor audit . --staged
```

These flags combine naturally with `--quick` for sub-second feedback:

```bash
# Quick rule scan on just the files you changed
governor audit . --changed-only --quick
```

The audit report metadata includes a `scan_mode` field indicating the filter applied (e.g., `"staged"`, `"changed-only"`, `"changed-since main"`).

## Pre-Commit Hook

Governor can install a git pre-commit hook that automatically scans staged files before every commit:

```bash
governor hooks install
```

This writes a pre-commit hook that runs `governor audit --staged --quick --fail-on high`. Commits are blocked if any high-severity findings are detected.

```bash
# Check hook status
governor hooks status

# Remove the hook
governor hooks remove

# Overwrite an existing pre-commit hook
governor hooks install --force
```

## Filtering Checks

You can control which checks run:

```bash
# Run only a specific check
governor audit ./my-app --only-check appsec

# Skip specific checks
governor audit ./my-app --skip-check deps_supply_chain --skip-check ssrf

# Run only built-in checks (ignore custom checks)
governor audit ./my-app --no-custom-checks
```

## CI/CD Integration Quick Start

Use `--fail-on` to set an exit-code threshold for your pipeline:

```bash
# Fail if any critical or high severity findings exist
governor audit ./my-app --fail-on high --no-tui

# Fail on any finding at all
governor audit ./my-app --fail-on info --no-tui
```

The exit code is non-zero when findings meet or exceed the specified severity, making it easy to gate deployments.

## Single-File Scanning

For quick checks on individual files without a full audit, use `governor scan`:

```bash
# Scan a single file for common issues
governor scan config.go

# Scan multiple files with JSON output
governor scan --json main.go config.go

# Fail if findings meet a severity threshold
governor scan --fail-on high config.go
```

This runs only rule-engine checks (no AI, no network) and prints findings to stdout. No workspace or output directory is created. See the [Scan Command](../README.md#scan-command) section for full flag reference.

## Comparing Audits

Use `governor diff` to compare two `audit.json` files and see what changed:

```bash
governor diff baseline/audit.json latest/audit.json
```

This shows new findings (regressions), resolved findings, and unchanged findings. Use `--fail-on` to gate CI on new regressions:

```bash
governor diff --fail-on high old.json new.json
```

See the [Diff Command](../README.md#diff-command) section for details.

## Ignoring Files

Create a `.governorignore` file in the root of your project to exclude paths from scanning:

```text
# Skip generated code
*.generated.go

# Skip test fixtures
fixtures/
**/test_data/**
```

Governor auto-detects `.governorignore` in the input root. Patterns follow gitignore syntax including negation (`!pattern`) and directory-only matching (`dir/`). See the [Ignore File](../README.md#ignore-file) section for full syntax.

## Project Auto-Detection

Governor automatically detects your project type and displays it in audit output. Detection is based on well-known marker files:

| Detected Type | Signal |
|---------------|--------|
| Next.js | `next.config.js`, `.mjs`, or `.ts` |
| Supabase | `supabase/config.toml` |
| Express | `express` in `package.json` dependencies |
| Fastify | `fastify` in `package.json` dependencies |
| FastAPI | `fastapi` in `requirements.txt` |
| Flask | `flask` in `requirements.txt` |
| Django | `django` in `requirements.txt` |
| Go | `go.mod` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` |
| Node.js | `package.json` (fallback) |
| Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py` (fallback) |

Detection is checked in priority order — the first match wins. For example, a project with both `next.config.js` and `package.json` is detected as Next.js, not generic Node.js.

The detected type appears in audit output:

```
detected:       Next.js
```
